Application for job opportunity

I would like to apply to the job opportunity of this link:

Hi,

My name is Paulo and I am a Bacharel and Master in Computer Science by University of São Paulo.

I am currently living in Brazil but I visited Hasselt and Hasselt University in November 2013 and I have plans to go back to Belgium again in the beginning of 2014. It was a very pleasant experience! I have an open request for Portuguese citizenship in progress, but right now I would need a work visa to move immediately.

My Master dissertation is about Automated Test Patterns [1] and I am passionate about object-oriented programming and programming languages. I have experience in Web and Mobile (iOS and Android) programming.

I have about 10 years of experience as a software developer, with many popular open source projects [2] and I have developed a complex system that deal with many programming languages and algorithms [3][4].

You can find a complete and detailed CV in english in the Web [5] as well as all links about me and my projects [6][7].

I am very thankful for your attention!
